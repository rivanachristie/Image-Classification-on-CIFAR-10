# Image Classification on CIFAR 10
In this project, classification of images in the CIFAR-10 dataset will be done using machine learning techniques.  I have used the following models and their variations:
1. Logistic Regression
2. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
3. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

# About the dataset
The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images.
