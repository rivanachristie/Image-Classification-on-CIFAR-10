# Image Classification on CIFAR 10
In this project, classification of images in the CIFAR-10 dataset will be done using machine learning techniques. The CIFAR-10 is a dataset of 50,000 32x32 colored training images and 10,000 test images, labeled with 10 categories. I have used the following models and their variations:
1. Logistic Regression
2. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
3. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
